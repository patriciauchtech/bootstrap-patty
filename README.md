# bootstrap-patty
(in progress)

I created one page bootstrap layout copying, pasting and modyfying code from bootstrap. With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS bootstrap is very easy and convinient to use. Bootstrap responsive CSS adjust to phones, tablets, and desktop, also mobile first styles are part of the main frame work. Bootstrap is also compatilble with modern browsers, I also learned about boiler plate template, text tags, handling images, container, grids and media break points, container fluids, changing layouts on different screens, color, nav bar and jumbotrons, buttons and href buttons.
